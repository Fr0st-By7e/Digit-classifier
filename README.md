# Digit Classifier

This repository contains two different implementations for handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset:

1. **TensorFlow Model**  
   A deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Achieves around **98% accuracy** on the test set.  
   - Uses fully connected neural networks (1 hidden layer) with TensorFlow backend.

3. **From Scratch Neural Network**  
   A basic neural network classifier implemented entirely from scratch using NumPy.  
   - Achieves around **84% accuracy** on the test set.
   - A simple 2 layer neural network (i.e. no hidden layers)  
   - Illustrates underlying mathematical concepts including forward propagation, backward propagation, activation functions, and gradient descent without high-level libraries.
